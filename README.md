The audio, images and tactile friction coefficients used in the paper are sourced from the LMT dataset. For detailed data and descriptions of the LMT dataset, please refer to the link https://zeus.lmt.ei.tum.de/downloads/texture/. The results of the tactile friction coefficients generated by the federated Transformer algorithm are demonstrated in the compressed package.
